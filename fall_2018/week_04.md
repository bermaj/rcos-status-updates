# Last Week's Accomplishments

> I completed and pushed the database migrations. I did not have a chance to speak with the Parking and Transportation 
  Services director. 

# This Week's Plan

> I will read documentation for and learn how to use the testing framework we plan on implementing, Jest. Additionally, 
I will try to schedule with the Parking and Transportation Services Director. Further, I will get a list of possible parking lots.
