# Last Week's Accomplishments

> Once again, the work on tests got pushed back to working on the presentation. I worked with the group 
> to create a slideshow and plan the demo.

> The director of the Office of Parking and Transportation had to cancel our meeting. I am
> holding off on setting up another to allow a more complete demo for him.


# This Week's Plan

> With what I hope is all other tasks out of the way, I will learn
  to use Jest and write tests.
