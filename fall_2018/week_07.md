# Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I worked on testing for the appeals controller. I created methods to support the test cases 
> and added appropriate functionality to make these work with the authentication. I worked with the database directly in these > cases so that endpoints could be tested individually in a number of corner cases.

# This Week's Plan

> I will write more tests this week.
