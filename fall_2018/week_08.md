# Last Week's Accomplishments

> This week I worked on testing appeal and verdict creation endpoints. This involved working with the repository layers created by Aaron and Dylan. I also worked with Aaron on creating black-box integration tests for these endpoints. These controller layers could use better abstraction for validation flow-interrupts.

# This Week's Plan

> I will write more integration tests this week so that the clients can assume that edge-cases function correctly. I want to get our coverage above 70%.
