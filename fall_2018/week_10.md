# Last Week's Accomplishments

> Last week, the plan to testing changed when our project lead suggested I start a major refactor on 
> frontend structure. While it may seem last minute, this was to set us up for next semester. 

# This Week's Plan

> We're done!

# Reflection

> This semester of RCOS was a good learning semester. I was a bit hestitant to jump more into Typescript. However, 
> the learning experience overall was invaluable. I was able to learn not only more about Typescript itself, but the
> the technologies we used. While the semester started slow, things begin to pick up, more so when I gained better 
> knowledge.

> More specificially, working on different aspects of the project was a great experience in learning. I started working
> on database migrations. From there, I worked on the client, the service, and finally the client again. This 
> gave me a broad experience of working on the web stack. Further, writing the tests was a good experience in verifying
> the contributions to the project. 

> I cannot wait to start again on this project next semester. With the goal of deployment by the end of the year, I am 
> extremely excited to get working again.
