# Last Week's Accomplishments

> Did initial setup of the base repository. Began playing with the 
    different serial commands for the newer Whistler models in Python. I am working to figure out 
    how to properly communicate with the radio.

# This Week's Plan

> Will begin writing the APIs to work with the serial commands.
