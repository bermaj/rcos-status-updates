Last Week's Accomplishments

My initial playing with the APIs had been done in Python and was not thorough, only exploring getting connected 
via serial and ensuring the connection would work properly. Before transiting to JavaScript from the Python, I 
experimented directly with the commands and handling the byte communication. This proved more difficult than I expected,
and I spent a significant amount of time making the communication work properly with the checksum. Further, decoded the 
responses were also troublesome in dealing with the different bits. 

This Week's Plan

I will finish figuring out how to properly handle the connection in python then transition the code to JavaScript.
