Last Week's Accomplishments

I was able to implement working code in python to communicate with the scanner and calculate a checksum properly. 
I have started implementing this in TypeScript and will finally be able to commit code to our repository 
that handles communication. 

This Week's Plan

I will do my implementation in TypeScript and commit this code to the repository.
