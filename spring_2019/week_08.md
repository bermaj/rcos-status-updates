Last Week's Accomplishments

I was able to fix the issue in TypeScript. I was not handling communication with the port correctly, however it now properly 
reads and writes. However, read does not quite work as needed. Right now, I am only able to log to the console the result
from read, but returning it causes issues. 

This Week's Plan

I will make read work fully and begin implementing further commands.
