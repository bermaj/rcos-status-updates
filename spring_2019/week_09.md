Last Week's Accomplishments

I worked on what I believe should fix my issue with read this week by making the call a Promise
and making it run asynchronously. I have not yet had a chance to test it with the hardware.
Additionally, I worked on reading the response produced by a Control Channel Dump. Unfortunately, it will be hard to test. Even 
if I emulate what I believe the data should look like, I cannot be certain it will look that way coming from the radio. The 
difficulty is that in order to get the radio to send the correct data, it would need to be receiving from each and every
type of system. I will have to find a solution to properly test this.

This week:

I will work on reading the responses from other commands and my presentation.
